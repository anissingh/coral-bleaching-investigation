# Coral Bleaching Investigation
This was my final project for my first year (first semester) computer science course at the Univeristy of Toronto. This project aimed to provide a visual representation of how the severity and frequency of coral bleaching has been affected by the rising sea water temperatures through an interactive map, a statistic bar graph, and simple linear regression.
